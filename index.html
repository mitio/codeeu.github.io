  <h1>Why learn to code?</h1>

  <p>In a world where we're surrounded by technology, and where so many of our interactions we have are with computers, learning to code helps us understand how these services work.</p>

  <p>What's more, learning to code gives us a powerful way to explore our ideas and make things, both for work and play.</p>

  <h1>Get involved</h1>

  <p>If your code club or group is meeting during Code Week, add your events to the <a href="http://events.codeweek.eu/">coding map of Europe</a>. Not yet part of a group? Organize a Code Week event in your area! We've prepared a <a href="http://events.codeweek.eu/guide/">#codeEU Toolkit for organizers</a> and a <a href="/resources/">list of resources</a> to get you started.</p>

  <p>Community groups, schools, companies and non-profits are all welcome to run a Code Week event. And while October 10 - 18 will be the biggest celebration of coding across Europe, we're looking forward to activities throughout the year.</p>

  <p>Have questions? Get in touch with <a href="http://events.codeweek.eu/ambassadors/">EU Code Week Ambassadors</a> in your country and find out more about how to volunteer, or even sponsor a local event.</p>
